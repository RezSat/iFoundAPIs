Python wrappers to APIs that I found from different places. These APIs may or may not work due to obvious reasons.

These APIs I wrap maybe public apis but doesn't have an direct python wrapper or private apis ( including that will give unrestricted access for premium/paid content).

Also if you are the owner of the API, don't sue me instead fix it from your side.
