# iFoundAPIs

Python wrappers to APIs that I found from different places. These APIs may or may not work due to obvious reasons.

Also if you are the owner of the API, please don't sue me instead fix it from your side, I'm just learning nothing more than that just having some fun.


| Application Name | Wrapper Name | Available Methods | Active/Inactive     |
